author: "Yann Forget, Michal Shimoni, Catherine Linard and Marius Gilbert."
abstract: "The rapid urbanization that takes place in developing regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa is threatening both social and environmental systems. In this context, remote sensing is essential to provide accurate and up-to-date spatial information to support risk assessment and decision making. However, mapping urban areas remains a challenge because of their heterogeneity, and previous studies have shown that developing regions are where the highest rates of misclassifications are observed in global urban maps. Likewise, urban areas located in arid climates --- which are among the most vulnerables to anthropogenic impacts, suffer from the spectral confusion occurring between built-up and bare soil areas when using optical imagery. Today, the increasing availability of satellite imagery from multiple sensors allow to tackle the aforementioned issues by combining optical data with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). In this paper, we assess the complementarity of the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 sensors to map built-up areas in twelve Sub-Saharan African case studies, using a pixel-level supervised classification based on the Random Forest classifier. The results suggest that combining both optical and SAR features consistently improves classification performances, by improving the differentiation between built-up and bare lands. However, textural information must formerly be extracted from SAR backscattering data in order to reduce the speckle noise and to introduce contextual information at the pixel level --- for instance, using Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) textures. The study provides insights regarding the optimal polarizations and window sizes to use for the computation of such textures. Nevertheless, the fusion was less beneficial in mountainous case studies, suggesting that including features derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) could improve the reliability of the proposed approach."

# Introduction

Urbanization is rapidly growing in the world, driving a large range of implications for environmental systems and human health [@Grimm2008;@Dye2008]. In Africa, the urban population is predicted to triple between 2010 and 2050, threatening both social and environmental sustainability [@UN-Habitat2015]. Monitoring built-up areas in developing regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa is therefore crucial to understand, predict, and mitigate the risks associated with such a rapid urbanization [@Linard2013]. In this context, remote sensing plays a major role by providing accurate spatial information on built-up areas at a relatively low cost [@Gamba2009a;@Wentz2014]. However, because of the heterogeneity of urban areas in terms of spatial structure and materials, mapping built-up with medium resolution optical imagery remains challenging. In medium spatial resolution imagery (10-50 meters), urban pixels are made of a combination of several elements --- such as buildings, roads, trees or bare soil. Furthermore, the spectral characteristics and the spatial distribution of these objects differ across a given urban area. High differences are also observed among the cities of the world because of socioeconomic, cultural, historical and environmental variations [@Forster1993;@Small2001;@Small2005]. Across the world, developing regions are among the most concerned with the urbanization-related risks. However, previous studies have shown that they also suffer from lower accuracies in global built-up maps [@Potere2009], because of a high urban heterogeneity coupled with a lack of reference datasets to support the training and the validation of the classification models.

Likewise, urban areas located in arid and semi-arid climates are among the most vulnerables to anthropogenic impacts. Despite the fact that about one third of the global land surface is characterized by an arid or semi-arid climate according to the Köppen-Geiger classification [@Kottek2006;@Rubel2017], they also suffer from low accuracies when it comes to built-up mapping. In fact, due to their overlapping spectral signatures, the differentiation between bare land and built-up in arid and semi-arid environments has proven to be one of the main drawback of optical sensors in urban remote sensing. Previous studies have shown that conventional spectral indices --- such as the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), the normalized difference bareness index (NDBal), or the urban index (UI), are not reliable to differentiate built-up areas from bare land in arid regions [@Qian2007;@Rasul2018]. As a result, new approaches based on object-oriented classification or linear spectral mixture analysis has been proposed [@Qian2007;@Zhang2015]. New spectral indices have also been specifically developed to tackle the issue, such as the normalized bare land index (NBLI) [@Li2017]. Likewise, the dry built-up index (DBI) and the dry bare-soil index (DBSI) provide a better separation between bare soil and built-up in arid regions by making use of the blue and thermal bands of Landsat 8 [@Rasul2018]. Approaches based on the thresholding of spectral indices do not require any training dataset and benefit from a low computational cost. However, as stated by their authors, their reliability highly depends on the landscape and the climate of the study area.

Because of the aforementioned issues, the idea of combining optical data with complementary sensors such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has rapidly developed in the context of urban remote sensing. In fact, the increased availability of satellite data from different sensors drives the recent developments in land cover classification [@Waske2008;@Zhang2010;@Gamba2014]. SAR has the advantages of providing high resolution imagery which is independent from daylight, clouds, or weather conditions. The C-band of the European Remote-Sensing Satellite 1 and 2 (ERS-1/2) has been widely used to monitor urban areas [@Weng2014a]. Contrary to optical sensors, SAR is sensitive to the roughness of the terrain --- and thus is able to better differentiate between bare soil and built-up [@Soergel2010]. Previous studies have shown that the combined use of optical and SAR data can significantly improves the accuracy of a land cover classification [@Waske2008;@Zhang2012;@Joshi2016]. However, classifying data provided by different sensors is not straightforward and there is no consensus among the remote sensing community regarding the best approach to perform the fusion. Conventional parametric classifiers which concatenate signals from different sensors into one vector has been shown to be inefficient in modeling multi-sensor data distributions, therefore most of the methods rely on machine learning classifiers that does not make any assumption regarding the data distribution [@Tupin2010]. Fusion can occur at four different levels: (1) at the signal level, (2) at the pixel level --- by concatenating data from multiple sensors into one stacked vector [@Griffiths2010;@Zhu2012a;@Zhang2014b;@Braun2015], (3) at the feature level in the context of an object-based classification that makes use of image segmentation techniques [@Clerici2017], or (4) at the decision level, for instance by merging several single-source classifiers using neural networks or support vector machines [@Benediktsson1999;@Fauvel2006;@Waske2008;@Shao2016].

Previous studies have reported that pixel-level fusion approaches are inappropriate because of the lack of information about the spatial context of a given pixel and the speckle noise inherent to SAR data [@Tupin2010;@Gamba2014;@Zhang2014b]. The extraction of textural features from SAR backscattering partially solves the aforementioned issues [@Zhang2014b;@Braun2015], for instance by computing the grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture features [@Haralick1973;@Gotlieb1990]. However, there is no consensus on which features are the most relevant in the context of a combined use with optical data, or on the optimal size of the moving window used to compute the GLCM.

In this paper, we investigate the combined use of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 imagery to detect built-up in twelve Sub-Saharan African case studies characterized by various climates, landscapes and population patterns. We assess the complementarity of optical and SAR data in the context of a pixel-level supervised classification based on the extraction of 18 GLCM texture features, with several window sizes and from the two polarizations available with Sentinel-1 --- VV and VH.

Table: Climate, landscape and population for each case study. Values are aggregated for the area of interest. Climate data is derived from the Koppen-Geiger classification [@Kottek2006;@Rubel2017]. Mean slope and elevation are computed from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) 30m [@NASAJPL2013]. Population is estimated using the AfriPop/WorldPop dataset [@Linard2012b;@Worldpop2016]. {#tbl:case-studies}

Compared to natural land covers, built-up areas are highly heterogeneous at both the interurban and the intraurban scales. As a result, a method developed in the context of an european urban areas has no guarantee to be reliable in a small urban agglomeration of Sub-Saharan Africa. This is why a diverse set of case studies is crucial when seeking to maximize the generalization potential of a method. In the context of built-up mapping using both optical and SAR data, the reliability of each sensor is expected to be highly dependent on landscape and climate variables. The selected case studies for the present analysis are presented in [@tbl:case-studies]. The area of interest for each case study corresponds to the rectangular 20 kilometers buffer around the city center.

The set contains urban areas with various climates, landscapes and population characteristics. In the context of built-up mapping from both optical and SAR data, optical sensors are expected to perform well in tropical, subtropical and temperate climates (Antananarivo, Bukavu, Chimoio, Kampala or Johannesburg) because of its ability to differentiate between the spectral signatures of built-up and vegetation. However, densely vegetated urbain mosaics could cause some confusion. On the contrary, SAR sensor is expected to perform better in dry climates (Dakar, Gao, Katsina, Saint-Louis, Ouagadougou or Windhoek), and lower in mountainous urban areas surrounded with dense vegetation and steep slopes (Antananarivo, Bukavu, or Windhoek). More generally, the various climates and population sizes ensure that multiple urban morphologies will be encountered.

Table: Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 products for each case study. {#tbl:satellite-imagery}

Landsat 8 imagery has been acquired through the Earth Explorer portal of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) with the `landsatxplore` software [@Forget2018], using cloud cover as the main criterion. Additionally, monthly NDVI values from the MODIS-based MOD13C2 dataset [@Didan2015] were used to favor the most vegetated periods, which are different depending on the case study. Scenes were acquired as Level-1 data products, thus radiometrically calibrated and orthorectified. Calibrated digital numbers were converted to surface reflectance values using the Landsat Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) [@Vermote2016] made available by the USGS. Cloudy pixels were masked using the Function of Mask (FMASK) algorithm [@Zhu2012;@Zhu2015].

Sentinel-1A images have been acquired through the Copernicus Open Access Hub using the `sentinelsat` software [@Clauss2018]. Scenes belonging to the dry season were favored based on the monthly NDVI values provided by the MODIS-based MOD13C2 dataset. Additionally, the CPC Global Unified Precipitation dataset [@Chen2008], provided by the NOAA Climate Prediction Center, was used to require at least two days without any precipitation before the acquisition date. The last criterion for the final scene selection was the temporal proximity to the selected Landsat 8 scene. The scenes were acquired as Ground Range Detected (GRD) Level-1 products in the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, therefore multi-looked and projected to ground range using an Earth ellipsoid model. Preprocessing was performed using the Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) [@ESA2018]. Firstly, orbit state vectors were refined with precise orbit files and GRD data was calibrated to $\beta$ nought. Then, thermal noise removal was performed before applying a speckle noise reduction based on a $3 \times 3$ Lee filter [@Lee1981], in order to reduce the speckle without destructing too much of the textural information. Finally, terrain flattening [@Small2011] and Range-Doppler terrain correction [@Small2008] were applied based on the SRTM 1-sec Digital Elevation Model (DEM).

## Feature extraction

GCLM textures were computed with an interpixel distance of 1 and 32 levels of quantization using Orfeo Toolbox [@Grizonnet2017], after a $2\%$ histogram cutting on the source data. GLCMs were constructed for the direction angles 0, 45, 90, and 135 degrees ; but only the average value was considered. The GLCMs were computed independently for each polarization (VV and VH) and multiple window sizes ($5 \times 5$, $7 \times 7$, $9 \times 9$, and $11 \times 11$). A set of 18 textures was extracted: energy, entropy, correlation, inertia, cluster shade, cluster prominence, haralick correlation, mean, variance, dissimilarity, sum average, sum variance, sum entropy, difference of entropies, difference of variances, and two information measures of correlation (IC1 and IC2). This resulted in the extraction of 72 texture features for each polarization, that is, 144 in total.

Several GLCMs texture features can be highly correlated, such as energy and entropy, or inertia and the inverse different moment. In order to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on each combination of polarization and window size. Only the first six components of each PCA --- which consistently explained more than 95% of the variance, were retained. This reduced the number of features from 144 to 48.

SAR features were reprojected to Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinate system after the computation of GLCM textures in order to minimize the destruction of textural information. All Landsat 8 bands --- including thermal bands, were retained as they were without any processing. They were co-registered to the spatial resolution of SAR products which is about 10 meters.

## Classification

The binary classification task --- built-up vs. non-built-up, was performed using the Random Forest (RF) classifier, which has been shown to be relatively performant in the context of multisource and multimodal data classification. The implementation was based on Python and a set of libraries, including: NumPy [@Oliphant2007], SciPy [@Oliphant2007], and Rasterio [@Gillies2013] for raster processing, Shapely [@Gillies2007] and Geopandas for vector processing and Scikit-learn [@Pedregosa2011] for machine learning. The Python code that supported the present study is available on Github (`todo: url`), and the associated datasets can be acquired through Zenodo (`todo: url`).

In order to assess the optimal combination of features in the context of a pixel-based supervised classification, 12 different classifications were performed using different input features. [@tbl:classification-schemes] lists the features used for each classification scheme. The schemes #1 to #9 were single-source classifications, based either on optical or SAR data. It has been suggested in previous studies that combining several window sizes can improve classification accuracies by including spatial information from multiple scales. The schemes #2 to #9 were designed to identify the optimal window size and polarization combination to classify built-up areas using Sentinel-1. Finally, the schemes #10 to #12 included both optical and SAR data with different window sizes for the computation of the GLCMs.

Table: Label, input features and number of dimensions of the 12 classification schemes. {#tbl:classification-schemes}

In the 12 classification schemes, RF ensemble was constructed with 50 trees and a maximum number of features per tree equal to the square root of the total number of features. Imbalance issues in the training dataset between the built-up and the non-built-up classes were overcome by a random over-sampling of the minority class [@Lemaitre2017]. Additionally, in order to ensure the reproducibility of the results, fixed random seeds were used.

## Validation

Reference polygons were digitized from very high spatial resolution imagery through Google Earth in order to support both the training and the validation of the classification models. Four land cover classes were collected: built-up, bare soil, low vegetation (sparse or small vegetation), and high vegetation (dense and tall vegetation). All non-built-up samples (bare soil, low vegetation and high vegetation) were concatenated to build the binary (built-up vs. non-built-up) training and validation datasets. However, specific land cover samples were also used to assess the performance of the models in specific areas. [@tbl:reference-count] shows the number of polygons collected for each land cover and each case study, together with the amount of resulting samples (in pixels) after rasterization.

Table: Number of reference pixels for each case study and land cover. Enclosed in brackets: the number of polygons before rasterization. {#tbl:reference-count}

In order to ensure the independence of the training and validation datasets, the reference samples were randomly splitted at the polygon level --- the samples inside a given polygon being characterized by a high spatial autocorrelation. Each classification is performed ten times with different random splits, then assessment metrics (F1-score, land cover accuracies) and classifier characteristics (feature importances, probabilities) were averaged for statistical and visual interpretation.

Table: F1-score obtained by each classification scheme in each case study (see [@tbl:classification-schemes] for the characteristics of each scheme). In red: best F1-score for a given case study. {#tbl:score-per-scheme}

[@tbl:score-per-scheme] presents the F1-score obtained with each classification scheme in each case study. In 9 case studies out of 12, optical-based schemes reached a higher F1-score than SAR-based schemes. The two case studies where SAR-based schemes appears the most superior are Gao (+7.6 points) and Katsina (+3.4 points): two small urban areas located in an arid climate characterized by a domination of bare land in the landscape. However, the trend is not confirmed by the low scores obtained by SAR-based schemes in cities such as Ouagadougou and Saint-Louis, which present similar characteristics. These results suggest that optical-based schemes are superior to SAR-based schemes in the context of pixel-based classifications from a single sensor. This can be explained by the speckle noise inherent to SAR data and by the loss of spatial resolution that occured during the computation of the GLCM textures. However, in 11 case studies out of 12, the multi-sensor classification schemes reached the highest F1-scores --- the only exception being Gao, where the SAR-based scheme performed better. In most of the case studies, complementing optical data with SAR features improved the classification performances, sometimes dramatically (+6.7 points in Chimoio, +6.6 in Saint-Louis, +5.8 in Gao, +4 in Bukavu and Katsina). This suggests that combining optical and SAR-based GLCM textures in the context of a pixel-based classification can be a reliable and robust strategy.

The performance of each classification scheme is summarised in [@fig:scores-boxplot], which confirms the previously observed trends. The difference between the various SAR-based classification schemes is also highlighted. Classifications based on the VV polarization reached higher scores compared to the ones based on the VH polarization. However, combining texture features derived from both polarizations appears to increase the reliability of the classification models, leading to higher scores and a lower standard deviation. Likewise, the window size used for the computation of the GLCM did influence the classification scores. In our case studies, larger window sizes led to higher scores and reduced the variability across the case studies. We previously stated the hypothesis according to which combining several window sizes could increase the classification performance by including spatial information from multiple scales. The results obtained tend to refute this hypothesis, as the schemes combining textures from two window sizes did not perform better. Generally, the fusion schemes consistently obtained the highest scores. However, contrary to the trend observed in single-sensor SAR-based schemes, combining optical data with larger window sizes textures does not seem to increase the classification performance. Fusion schemes that include textures computed with smaller window sizes ($5 \times 5$ and $9 \times 9$) benefited from slightly less variability across the case studies.

Multispectral and thermal groups correspond to the Landsat 8 bands.](figures/feature_importances.pdf){#fig:feature-importances width=50%}

In classifiers based on a forest of decision trees such as RF, the relative contribution of each feature can be evaluated through the feature importance measure. The value ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 would indicate a feature that does not contribute to the classification, and 1.0 a feature that alone classifies all samples. [@fig:feature-importances] shows the repartition of the importance measure across the input features used in the fusion classification scheme, grouped by data source: VV or VH polarization for SAR data, and multispectral or thermal for optical data. Generally, texture features derived from the VV polarization and multispectral bands from Landsat 8 were the features contributing the most to the construction of the decision trees. Considering the lower scores obtained in single-sensor classification schemes with SAR data, lower importances for SAR features could be expected. However, the grouped importance of SAR features was superior to the importance of optical features in 5 case studies, and exceeded 40% of the contribution in 10 case studies. Furthermore, the relative importance of optical and SAR features did not appear correlated with their respective scores in the context of a single-sensor classification. For instance, in Antananarivo and Nairobi, the best SAR-based classification scheme reached a F1-score lower than the optical-based scheme by, respectively, 4.2 and 3.9 points. However, in the context of the fusion scheme, the contribution of SAR features was superior to the contribution of optical features. This suggests that the combination of both optical and SAR features contributes an information to the classifier that cannot be modeled in the context of a single-sensor classification.

![Classification accuracy in specific land covers for each scheme.](figures/accuracy_per_landcover.pdf){#fig:accuracy-landcover width=50%}

As previously stated, including SAR-based textural information to an optical-based classification is expected to improve the classification performance in bare lands. [@fig:accuracy-landcover] shows the mean accuracy of each classification scheme in three non-built-up land covers: bare soil, low vegetation and high vegetation. As expected, the performance of the classification model in bare soil areas was superior in SAR-based schemes than in optical-based schemes. On the contrary, SAR-based classification schemes, especially the ones based on the VH polarization, suffered from low accuracies in densely vegetated areas. Finally, fusion schemes based on both SAR and optical data benefited from the complementarity between both sensors and present high accuracies in the three land covers.

[@fig:katsina] shows the probabilistic output of three different classifiers: one based only on optical data, and two based on both optical and SAR data with different GLCM window sizes. Visually, the fusion classifiers appears to better distinguish between the built-up areas and the surrounding bare lands. This leads to lower rates of misclassification after thresholding of the probabilities, as previously shown by the assessment metrics. A side effect of the data fusion is the disappearance of the road network from the built-up class. Indeed, the classifier highly relies on the textural information from the SAR features to discriminate between built-up and bare land, and roads are therefore excluded from the built-up class.

There is some cases where data fusion is less beneficial. [@fig:bukavu] shows the probabilistic output of the optical, SAR, and fusion schemes in Bukavu. This case study, located in a mountainous area, presents two major obstacles for SAR data: dense vegetation in the north-west and steep slopes in the south-east. Mapping the probabilistic output of the SAR-based classifier reveals the confusion occurring in these areas. As a result, the probabilistic output of the fusion-based classifier appears nearly as a copy of the optical-based one.

# Conclusion

With the increasing availability of free imagery from multiple sensors such as Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8, data fusion is one of the main challenge in remote sensing. The objective of this paper was to assess the combined use of both Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1 imagery with a fusion scheme that relies on a simple pixel-based classifier. The main expectation was a better discrimination between built-up and bare soil areas in the context of urban mapping in Sub-Saharan Africa. The results of the present study suggest that the complementarity between medium resolution optical and SAR sensors can be exploited in the context of a supervised pixel-based classification. However, to make the pixel-based approach effective, textural information must be extracted from SAR backscattering in order to reduce the speckle noise and to provide contextual information at the pixel level.

Classification schemes including both optical and SAR features reached the highest scores in 11 case studies out of 12, increasing the mean F1-score from 0.91 --- using only optical data, to 0.95. Single-sensor classifiers making use of GLCM textures derived from the VV polarization outperformed the ones based on the VH polarization. However, combining both polarizations consistently increased the classification performance. Likewise, large GLCM window sizes ($9 \times 9$ or $11 \times 11$) provided a slight improvement of the classification performance both in the context of single-sensor classification and in fusion schemes. However, contrary to an hypothesis that we formulated, combining textures derived from multiple GLCM window sizes --- in order to include spatial information from multiple scales at the pixel level, did not lead to a better classification performance. The visual interpretation of the results obtained suggests that small GLCM window sizes favor the detection of isolated settlements and buildings, whereas larger window sizes lead to a better differentiation between built-up areas and bare lands. In the context of this study, the RF classifier was not able to take advantage of both.

The assessment of the classifiers performances in specific land covers confirmed the high level of complementarity between the two sensors. Single-sensor SAR-based classifications presented high accuracies in bare soil areas, but suffered from a confusion between dense vegetation and buildings. On the contrary, optical-based classifiers shown a high ability to discriminate between vegetation and built-up, but a low differentiation between bare soil and built-up --- especially in the most arid landscapes such as in Gao or Katsina. This complementarity was correctly modeled by the RF classifier and, as a result, the fusion schemes presented high accuracies in both bare lands and vegetated areas.

Nevertheless, the fusion was less beneficial in case studies characterized by the presence of dense vegetation and steep slopes --- for instance in a mountainous and subtropical urban areas such as Bukavu. However, in this case, the RF classifier was able to learn from the training dataset that SAR data were not reliable. This suggests that including features derived from a DEM --- for instance slope and aspect, could improve the model ability to quantify the reliability of SAR data at the pixel level. Such a strategy could also take place at the decision level. Further work is also required to assess the reliability of the presented approach in the context of similar sensors such as Sentinel-2, ERS-1 and ERS-2.
