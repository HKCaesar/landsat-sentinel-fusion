  abstract =      {Abstract The population of Africa is predicted to
                   double over the next 40 years, driving exceptionally
                   high urban expansion rates that will induce
                   significant socio-economic, environmental and health
                   changes. In order to prepare for these changes, it is
                   important to better understand urban growth dynamics
                   in Africa and better predict the spatial pattern of
                   rural-urban conversions. Previous work on urban
                   expansion has been carried out at the city level or
                   at the global level with a relatively coarse
                   5\textendash{}10~km resolution. The main objective of
                   the present paper was to develop a modelling approach
                   at an intermediate scale in order to identify factors
                   that influence spatial patterns of urban expansion in
                   Africa. Boosted Regression Tree models were developed
                   to predict the spatial pattern of rural-urban
                   conversions in every large African city. Urban change
                   data between circa 1990 and circa 2000 available for
                   20 large cities across Africa were used as training
                   data. Results showed that the urban land in a 1~km
                   neighbourhood and the accessibility to the city
                   centre were the most influential variables. Results
                   obtained were generally more accurate than results
                   obtained using a distance-based urban expansion model
                   and showed that the spatial pattern of small, compact
                   and fast growing cities were easier to simulate than
                   cities with lower population densities and a lower
                   growth rate. The simulation method developed here
                   will allow the production of spatially detailed urban
                   expansion forecasts for 2020 and 2025 for Africa,
